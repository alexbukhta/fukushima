        <h2 class="featurette-heading">How does Radioactive Material Spread?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Radioactive material from weapons testing, nuclear power plant meltdowns, and natural sources can spread in various ways. Radioactive material leaking can be carried by the wind, dissolved in water, and even spread around by a careless person. <b>It is important to note that it is the radioactive material that can spread - radiation itself does not spread. Radiation is emitted from the radioactive material that has been inadvertently spread.</b></p>
        <br/>
        <p>Most of the time, the radioactive materials and radiation are contained within four layers of protection in a nuclear reactor. The nuclear chain reaction is contained inside the steel Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV). The RPV is housed inside another steel container called the Pressure Containment Vessel (PCV). That structure is in turn encased in a thick layer of concrete, making up the Dry Well (DW). FInally, the building containing all of the above is kept at a slight negative pressure, ensuring that all particles stay inside the reactor building during normal operation.  Furthermore, spent fuel is kept under water which prevents any radioactive material and radiation from escaping into the outside world. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>In order to get an idea of just how well-protected the reactor is, consider the fact that the crew of a nuclear submarine receives, on average, an effective dose of only 0.3 mSv per year! [32] The worldwide average background radiation is 2.4 mSv/year, meaning that the submarine crew, living several meters from a nuclear reactor, receives eight times less radiation than the average human receives from background sources. [4], [8] When nuclear reactors function under the conditions for which they were designed, radioactive material does not spread.</p>

        <p>In the case of a nuclear accident like Chernobyl or Fukushima-Daiichi, the core meltdown results in damage to the reactor and the layers of protection that keep the radioactive material and radiation contained. Radioactive material can escape the building and get spread to the surrounding areas by wind, water, vehicles, and people. There really is no mystery to how this happens - radioactive particles simply get on your car, clothes, shoes, or skin and follow you around like a stain until you wash them off. Similarly, if you drink water or breathe air contaminated with radioactive material, the particles can lodge themselves in your body, damaging you with radiation from within. <a href="/lesson6">How does radiation damage humans?</a></p>
        <br/>
        <p>It is for this very reason that cleanup workers at Fukushima-Daiichi wear the protective white suits - the white tyvek suits do not block radiation, they simply prevent radioactive material from getting on the workers clothes and skin, minimizing the spread of radioactive material outside the plant. Likewise, the breathing apparatus is intended to keep radioactive particles out of the workersâ€™ lungs. </p>
