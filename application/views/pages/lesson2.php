        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What are the Different Types of Radiation?</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>There are four types of radiation - alpha, beta, gamma, x-ray, and neutron.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Alpha radiation is a particle consisting of two neutrons and two protons having a net charge of +2. This type of radiation is heavy and slow in comparison to beta, gamma, and neutron radiation. <b>Alpha particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper, clothing, or the outer layer of skin and can travel only several centimeters in air.</b> As a result, alpha particles are only dangerous if they come from nuclear decay within our bodies where they can damage sensitive tissues directly.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Beta radiation is a fast moving electron or positron. You can think of a positron as a positively charged electron. <b>Unlike alpha radiation, beta particles can penetrate human skin and are capable of traveling a few meters in air. Beta radiation is effectively stopped by a few millimeters of aluminum,</b> depending on the energy of the electron or positron. Strontium-90 (Sr-90), Tritium (H-3), and Carbon-14 (C-14) are examples of isotopes that emit only Beta radiation.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Neutron radiation is simply a neutron, one of the particles which makes up an atomic nucleus. <b>Neutrons are the most penetrating type of radiation, stopped only by a thick layer of concrete or water. Neutrons are the only type of nuclear radiation capable of making stable, non-radioactive atoms unstable (radioactive).</b> </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Gamma radiation is a very energetic form of light. You might have heard that prolonged exposure to the sun can increase your chances of getting skin cancer. This is because the sun produces Ultraviolet radiation, a form of light that carries more energy than the light from the light bulb you use to light your home at night. Gamma radiation carries between 1,000 and 100,000 times more energy than Ultraviolet, therefore you need much less gamma radiation to cause the same damage as sunbathing in the sunâ€™s ultraviolet radiation. <b>Gamma radiation can travel several meters in air and is effectively blocked by a few centimeters of lead.</b></p>
        <br/>
        <p>X-Ray radiation is a form of light that falls between ultraviolet and gamma - it carries more energy than ultraviolet but less than gamma. <b>X-Rays are used in medical imaging because they can penetrate the human body but are safe in small doses. X-Rays can be blocked by a few centimeters of lead.</b> During your regular dental checkup, the dentist places that heavy lead apron over your chest while taking an X-Ray of your teeth in order to prevent any unnecessary exposure of your body to the X-Rays. </p>
