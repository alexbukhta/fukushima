	 	<p>All radiation produced by nuclear decay, with the exception of neutrons, is what is known as ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is capable of knocking the electrons of other atoms out of orbit, creating ions. In fact, all light higher in energy than visible light is ionizing - Ultraviolet rays are mildly ionizing while X-Rays and Gamma rays are more energetic and therefore more likely to knock electrons out of orbit. </p>
	 	<br/>
	 	<p>The essence of the problem with ionizing radiation is that it can damage cells and cause breaks in the DNA, the genetic code of living things. Breaks in DNA are actually very common and the human body has an internal protein machinery set up to mend these breaks. Ionizing radiation is problematic because it increases the frequency of DNA breaks - the internal repair machinery is not able to keep up. Cells with damaged DNA either die or continue dividing, giving rise to mutations. These mutations can be harmless or result in an abnormal cancer cell - the source of cancerous growths.</p>
	 	<br/>
	 	<p>An increased risk of cancer is the primary risk of ionizing radiation received in small doses over a long period of time. On the other hand, large levels of radiation received rapidly are capable of killing the more delicate cells in the body, producing immediately observable symptoms in addition to the long term risk of cancer. At a single dose of 1,000 mSv, the cells of the intestines are damaged and cannot absorb water of nutrients, resulting in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a feeling of general weakness. 3,000 mSv is enough to damage cells of the immune system, leaving the individual susceptible to disease and infection. 5,000 mSv will kill 50% of the people exposed to that level of radiation within 60 days. They will most likely die from the damaged immune system being unable to fight off infections. 10,000 mSv means certain death. [32], [33] In reality, such doses are very rare and are provided here only to show the scope of the problem with ionizing radiation.</p>
