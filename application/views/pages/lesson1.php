        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Radioactivity and Radiation?</h2><br/>
        <p>Everything in the universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms themselves are made up of even smaller particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons.  <b>Each atom has a nucleus made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons.</b> Each chemical element is characterized by the number of protons in its nucleus - 92 protons in the nucleus makes it a Uranium atom, 6 makes it Carbon. <b>Most atoms of  an element can exist in different forms called isotopes. Isotopes are differentiated from each other by the number of neutrons that the atomic nucleus contains.</b> Uranium, for example, always has 92 protons. However, it can have either 146 or 143 neutrons, making it U-238 or U-235 respectively. The number after the U represents the sum of protons and neutrons.</p>
      	<br/>
      	<p>Most atoms are stable - they are satisfied with the number of protons and neutrons making up their nucleus. Some atoms are unstable - they are not satisfied with the composition of their nucleus. In an effort to become stable, the unstable atoms undergo nuclear decay - they change to number of protons and neutrons making up their nuclei. <b>Radioactivity, otherwise known as radioactive decay, is the process through which an unstable atomic nucleus becomes stable, releasing energy and particles in the process. The emitted energy and particles are called radiation.</b> Unstable atoms can be found in nature and are also produced as byproducts of nuclear reactor operation.</p>
